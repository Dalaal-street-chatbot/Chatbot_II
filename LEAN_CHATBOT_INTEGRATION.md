# LEAN CHATBOT INTEGRATION GUIDE

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for integrating the Lean algorithmic trading framework with your existing Dalaal Street chatbot using deep learning techniques. The integration allows your chatbot to understand, analyze, and respond to queries about Lean's codebase, architecture, and algorithmic trading functionality.

## What is Lean?

Lean is an open-source algorithmic trading engine developed by QuantConnect. It's designed for strategy research, backtesting, and live trading across multiple asset classes. Lean is primarily written in C# and provides a robust framework for quantitative finance.

## Integration Components

This integration consists of three main scripts:

1. **lean_code_integrator.py**: Extracts and processes Lean's codebase to generate training data
2. **lean_ml_trainer.py**: Builds deep learning models using TensorFlow based on the extracted data
3. **lean_trainer_addon.py**: Integrates the Lean models with your existing Dalaal Street chatbot

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Existing Dalaal Street chatbot
- Lean codebase (Lean-Master directory)
- Additional Python packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

### Directory Structure

Ensure your directory structure looks like this:

```
YourWorkspace/
  ├── Lean-Master/
  │   └── ... (Lean source code)
  ├── ml_training/
  │   ├── data/
  │   │   ├── lean/  # Lean training data
  │   │   └── ...    # Existing training data
  │   ├── models/
  │   │   ├── lean/  # Lean models
  │   │   └── ...    # Existing models
  │   └── ml_orchestrator.py  # Your existing orchestrator
  ├── app/
  │   └── services/  # Where inference pipeline will be installed
  ├── lean_code_integrator.py
  ├── lean_ml_trainer.py
  └── lean_trainer_addon.py
```

### Step 1: Configure Paths

Before running the scripts, update the paths in each file:

```python
# In each script (lean_code_integrator.py, lean_ml_trainer.py, lean_trainer_addon.py)
LEAN_PATH = r'c:\path\to\Lean-Master'  # Update this to your Lean path
DESKTOP_PATH = r'c:\Users\hatao\OneDrive\Desktop'  # Update if needed
```

### Step 2: Extract Code and Generate Training Data

Run the code integrator script to scan Lean's codebase and generate training data:

```bash
python lean_code_integrator.py
```

This process will:
- Scan Lean's directories for C# and Python files
- Extract classes, methods, and documentation
- Generate conversation templates for chatbot training
- Create training data files in the `ml_training/data/lean/` directory
- Generate a framework guide with information about Lean

### Step 3: Train Deep Learning Models

Train the machine learning models using the generated data:

```bash
python lean_ml_trainer.py
```

This script will:
- Load and preprocess the conversation data
- Build an intent classifier using bidirectional LSTM
- Build a component classifier using bidirectional LSTM
- Train the models and save them to `ml_training/models/lean/`
- Create an inference pipeline for making predictions

### Step 4: Integrate with Dalaal Street Chatbot

Install the Lean trainer addon for integration with your existing chatbot:

```bash
python lean_trainer_addon.py --install
```

This will:
- Register the Lean trainer with your ML orchestrator
- Copy the inference pipeline to your application's services directory
- Create an integration example and guide

### Step 5: Combined Training

Train your chatbot with both Dalaal Street and Lean data:

```bash
python train_bot.py all
```

## Integration Architecture

### Data Flow

1. **Code Analysis**: Lean's codebase is analyzed to extract classes and methods
2. **Training Data Generation**: Conversation templates are created from extracted code
3. **Model Training**: Deep learning models are trained using the templates
4. **Inference Pipeline**: Models are used to classify and route user queries
5. **Response Generation**: Appropriate responses are generated based on classification

### Machine Learning Models

#### Intent Classifier
- **Purpose**: Identifies the category of the user's query
- **Architecture**: Bidirectional LSTM network
- **Input**: User's natural language query
- **Output**: Query category (e.g., 'lean_framework', 'lean_method')

#### Component Classifier
- **Purpose**: Identifies the specific Lean component being asked about
- **Architecture**: Bidirectional LSTM network with additional dense layers
- **Input**: User's natural language query
- **Output**: Lean component name (e.g., 'QCAlgorithm', 'Portfolio')

### Integration with Existing Chatbot

The integration leverages your existing ML orchestrator:

```python
# In your existing ML orchestrator
from app.services.lean_model_inference import LeanModelInference

# Initialize Lean model inference
lean_model_path = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'ml_training', 'models', 'lean')
lean_inference = LeanModelInference(lean_model_path)

# In your query processing pipeline
def process_query(query):
    # Check if it's a Lean-related query
    lean_analysis = lean_inference.analyze_query(query)
    
    if lean_analysis['category']['confidence'] > 0.7:
        # Use Lean models to handle the query
        # ...
    else:
        # Use existing chatbot logic
        # ...
```

## Usage Examples

### Example Queries

Users can ask questions about Lean such as:

- "How does the QCAlgorithm class work in Lean?"
- "What methods are available in the Portfolio class?"
- "Can you explain how universe selection works in Lean?"
- "What is the purpose of the Alpha Framework in Lean?"
- "Show me an example of a simple Lean algorithm"

### Example Response

For a query like "How does the QCAlgorithm class work in Lean?", the chatbot might respond:

```
In Lean's framework, the `QCAlgorithm` class is a key component for algorithmic trading.

The QCAlgorithm class is the base class for all algorithms in Lean. It provides the core functionality and methods needed to implement a trading strategy.

Key methods:
- `Initialize()` - Sets up the algorithm configuration
- `OnData()` - Handles incoming market data events
- `SetHoldings()` - Manages portfolio allocation
- `Buy()` and `Sell()` - Execute trades
- `Plot()` - Creates custom charts and visualizations

This class is part of Lean's quantitative trading architecture, which provides a robust framework for developing and testing trading strategies.

To use this class in your algorithm, you would typically create a class that inherits from QCAlgorithm:

```csharp
public class MyAlgorithm : QCAlgorithm
{
    public override void Initialize() 
    {
        // Setup your algorithm
    }
    
    public override void OnData(Slice data)
    {
        // Handle market data
    }
}
```

Would you like me to explain any specific method of this class in more detail?
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Code Extraction

You can customize which parts of the Lean codebase are processed by modifying the `algorithm_dirs` list in `lean_code_integrator.py`:

```python
self.algorithm_dirs = ['Algorithm', 'Algorithm.Framework', 'Algorithm.CSharp', 'Tests']
```

### Adjusting Model Architecture

To modify the model architecture, edit the model building functions in `lean_ml_trainer.py`:

```python
def build_intent_classifier(self, num_categories):
    model = Sequential([
        Embedding(self.max_words, self.embedding_dim, input_length=self.max_sequence_length),
        Bidirectional(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True)),
        # Modify architecture here
    ])
    # ...
```

### Fine-tuning Training Parameters

Adjust training parameters in `lean_ml_trainer.py`:

```python
self.max_words = 10000            # Vocabulary size
self.max_sequence_length = 300    # Sequence length
self.embedding_dim = 300          # Embedding dimension
self.validation_split = 0.2       # Validation split
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Data Extraction Errors

**Problem**: Error processing Lean code files
**Solution**: 
- Check file paths and permissions
- Ensure Lean codebase is properly downloaded
- Try expanding file extension support in `lean_code_integrator.py`

#### Model Training Errors

**Problem**: TensorFlow errors during training
**Solution**:
- Ensure TensorFlow is properly installed

### Logging and Debugging

Enable verbose logging by adding these lines to the scripts:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, 
                   format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
```
